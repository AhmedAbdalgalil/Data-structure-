# Data-structure-
linked list and dynamic array implementation
-----------------------------------------

Dear all

In this assignment, I would like you, as groups of 3 students, to do the following

I would like student #1 to make a local repo
The project should start with some welcome text in the main function
Create a structure representing student information consisting of the following:
Student name
Student ID (integer)
Student date of birth in 3 integers (day, month, year)
Student score of last year (integer)
Then submit the repo to github
Student 2 and 3 should get the repo from github
Each of student 2 and 3 should make a separate branch
Student 2 should develop functions to develop a linked list (use both head and tail pointers) consisting of N students and do the following operations
Insert a new student in the beginning
Insert a new student at the end
Insert a new student in the middle
Student 3 should develop functions to make a dynamic array consisting of N students and do the same operations as linked lists
The two branches should be merged and the two functions should appear in the main branch
The three students should work together to do the following for three different values of N (small, medium, large)
Calculate the size taken by the structure in the memory
Calculate the size taken by one node of the linked list
Calculate the time (in any way) taken when inserting a new item in the three positions previously mentioned
Compare the time taken by linked list vs the time taken by array for insertion at different positions
